# Groovy Essentials for Nextflow Developers

This directory contains the supporting materials for the [Groovy Essentials side quest](../../docs/side_quests/groovy_essentials.md).

## Contents

- `main.nf` - Comprehensive workflow demonstrating all Groovy concepts from the side quest
- `nextflow.config` - Configuration file showcasing Nextflow's parameter system and profiles
- `data/` - Sample input data for the tutorial
  - `samples.csv` - Sample metadata CSV file with realistic bioinformatics data
  - `sequences/` - Sample FASTQ files for testing workflows
  - `metadata/` - Additional metadata files (YAML configuration examples)
- `templates/` - Template scripts demonstrating Nextflow's templating system

## Quick Start

To run the demonstration workflow:

```bash
cd side-quests/groovy_essentials
nextflow run main.nf
```

The workflow will demonstrate all the Groovy patterns covered in the side quest:

1. **Nextflow vs Groovy boundaries** - See how workflow orchestration differs from programming logic
2. **String processing** - Pattern matching and file name parsing examples
3. **Conditional logic** - Dynamic strategy selection based on sample characteristics
4. **Error handling** - Validation and graceful error recovery patterns
5. **Essential Groovy operators** - Safe navigation, Elvis operator, Groovy Truth, and slashy strings
6. **Advanced closures** - Named closures, function composition, currying, and scope access
7. **Collection operations** - Advanced data processing with Groovy's collection methods

## Testing the Workflow

You can test different aspects of the workflow:

```bash
# Run with different quality thresholds
nextflow run main.nf --quality_threshold_min 30 --quality_threshold_high 45

# Use the testing profile for reduced resource usage
nextflow run main.nf -profile test

# Run in stub mode to test logic without executing tools
nextflow run main.nf -stub
```

## Learning Objectives

This side quest teaches essential Groovy skills for Nextflow developers:

- **Language boundaries**: Distinguish between Nextflow workflow orchestration and Groovy programming logic
- **String processing**: Use regular expressions and pattern matching for bioinformatics file names
- **Command building**: Transform file collections into command-line arguments using Groovy methods
- **Conditional logic**: Implement intelligent routing and process selection based on sample characteristics
- **Error handling**: Add validation, try-catch patterns, and graceful failure management
- **Essential operators**: Master safe navigation, Elvis operator, Groovy Truth, and slashy strings for robust code
- **Advanced closures**: Master named closures, function composition, currying, and functional programming patterns
- **Collection operations**: Process and organize large datasets using Groovy's powerful collection methods

## Progressive Learning

The `main.nf` file demonstrates a complete sample processing pipeline that evolves from basic metadata handling to a sophisticated, production-ready workflow. Each section builds on the previous, showing how Groovy transforms simple Nextflow workflows into powerful data processing systems.

Follow the [main documentation](../../docs/side_quests/groovy_essentials.md) for detailed explanations, step-by-step examples, and hands-on exercises that correspond to each section of the demonstration workflow.

## Next Steps

After completing this side quest, you'll be ready to:

- Write cleaner workflows with proper separation between Nextflow and Groovy logic
- Handle complex file naming conventions and input formats gracefully
- Build intelligent pipelines that adapt to different sample types and data characteristics
- Write null-safe, robust code using essential Groovy operators
- Create reusable, maintainable code using advanced closure patterns and functional programming
- Process large-scale datasets efficiently using advanced collection operations
- Add robust error handling for production-ready workflows
